# Travelling-Budget-Manage
It manages Travel Budget....

This is a simple app made with Fyne Framework.
This project includes 2 sorts and 2 searches for the algorithm of this app.
This project was originally made to run in the terminal but later on was transfered to Fyne to make things easier for the eyes. :D
Hence the original terminal made code is in the "TerminalProgram" folder. Which can be run at your any code editor and even in the Windows CMD with the command "go run main.go".
Meanwhile the application source code is in the main.go outside of the "TerminalProgram" folder, the app can be downloaded from the zip or again can be locally run on the windows CMD by again with the command "go run main.go".

How to Download : 
(Terminal Version) : 
1. Download the main.go file inside the "TerminalProgram" folder and then run it in your local terminal or copy paste the code and run it in an online compiler

(Software Version) : 
1. Download the zip folder
2. Extract it
3. Done!
